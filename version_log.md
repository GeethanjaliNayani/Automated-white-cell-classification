# Version Log – WBC Classification Project

- **v1.0 – Initial Version**  
  - Setup data loading, basic preprocessing, segmentation pipeline  
  - Built baseline classifiers (e.g. SVM, Random Forest)  
  - Visualized detection and classification outputs  

- **v1.1 – Deep Learning Models Added**  
  - Integrated CNN model (e.g. simple CNN or transfer learning)  
  - Added training/validation split and metrics logging  
  - Plotted confusion matrix and sample predictions  

- **v1.2 – Refinement & Enhancements**  
  - Improved segmentation accuracy  
  - Added probability scores and thresholding  
  - Included error analysis (misclassifications visualization)  

- **v1.3 – Planned Enhancements**  
  - Deploy as web app / API  
  - Extend to detect overlapping cells  
  - Add augmentations for more robust training
